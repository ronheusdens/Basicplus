Testing machine code support...

Test 1: VARPTR function
VARPTR(A) =16449
PASS - Valid address

Test 2: DEFUSR statement
DEFUSR = 5000
PASS - DEFUSR set

Test 3: Prepare machine code
POKE'd values at 5000-5002
PEEK(5000) =42
PEEK(5001) =123
PEEK(5002) =255

Test 4: USR() with default address
USR() =42 (byte at DEFUSR address)
PASS

Test 5: USR(addr) with explicit address
USR(5001) =123
PASS

Test 6: Multiple variables
VARPTR(X) =16472
VARPTR(Y) =16473
VARPTR(Z$) =19210
PASS - All addresses within range

Test 7: Change DEFUSR address
USR() after DEFUSR=5002: 255
PASS

All machine code tests complete!
